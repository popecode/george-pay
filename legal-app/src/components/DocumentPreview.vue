<p><strong>25 Feb 2018</strong><p>

<p>Dear Frank,</p>
<p>I am writing about a concern I have in relation to certain employee entitlements that I do not believe I have received.</p>
<p>I was employed by you between <strong>1st Jan 2018</strong> and <strong>3rd March</strong> on a <strong>Part-Time</strong> basis as a Cashier</p>
<p>I understand that my employment is subject to <strong>Fast Food Industry Award 2010 (MA000003)</strong>. Under <strong>Fast Food Industry Award 2010 (MA000003)</strong>, I believe I am entitled to <strong>$566.70 in wages, $300 in notice payment, $466.30 in annual leave with a total of $2040.84</strong> in outstanding payments.</p>
<p>I have included documents outlining my entitlements in support of my claim.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your consideration of this matter. If I do not hear from you within 7 days, I will consider lodging a small claims application with the Victoria Tribunal Court.  Information in relation to your obligations can be found at www.fairwork.gov.au.  Alternatively you may wish to seek independent legal advice.</p>
<p>I look forward to an early resolution of this matter.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Tom Jones</p>
